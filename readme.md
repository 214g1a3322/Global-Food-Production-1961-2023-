Data Analysis using Power-BI On Global Food Production 1961-2023

The analysis of global food production between 1961 and 2023 highlights the large-scale cultivation of key food crops across different regions. Rice and wheat dominate global production, with a total of 269 billion tonnes of rice and 282 billion tonnes of wheat produced during the period. Tea production, though smaller in comparison, stands at 2 billion tonnes, which reflects its importance as a global beverage crop.
When looking at coffee production, Africa and Latin America lead the way, followed by countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil. These nations are known as major coffee exporters, supporting global demand. Similarly, the production of fruits such as apples, avocados, bananas, and oranges varies significantly by country, with Central Asia, Latin America, and parts of Europe contributing notable shares.

The historical trend of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, and rice shows a steady rise from 1961 onwards, with production accelerating especially after the 1980s. This reflects technological advancements in agriculture, including the Green Revolution, improved irrigation, and the adoption of high-yield crop varieties. By 2023, wheat production exceeded 20 billion tonnes annually, while rice and maize followed similar upward patterns.

The maize production breakdown by year highlights a sharp growth trajectory. Earlier years such as 1951 and 1961 contributed only small portions, whereas more recent years, especially after 1990, account for the majority of global maize output. For example, production in 2006 alone contributed over 15% of the total maize yield, demonstrating the increasing importance of maize as both a food staple and a source of animal feed and biofuel.

Overall, the data emphasizes the growing global dependence on staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize, while highlighting the significant contributions of coffee, tea, and fruits to international trade and consumption. The steady growth across decades also signals the impact of population growth, globalization, and advancements in agricultural practices.
